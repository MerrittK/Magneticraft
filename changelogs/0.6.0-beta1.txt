!!WARNING!!

MAGNETICRAFT WILL NO LONGER WORK WITH JAVA 7 AND OLDER! PLEASE UPDATE TO JAVA 8!

!!WARNING END!!


ADDED

-Shelving Unit: a storage multiblock that stores up to 648 (24 chests) stacks, has a search bar (Name or Ore Dictionary search) and is well-suited for early game storage.

-Magneticraft is now available in Chinese (zh_CN).

-Galena can now be processed by Magneticraft machines.


CHANGED:

-Multiblocks are somewhat safer to use on chunk loading borders now. Still unrecommended.

-Inserters will now place items as space for them appears instead of trying to place whole stack at once and failing.


FIXED:

-Infinite water no longer pretends it's an actual water block.

-Inserters now properly interact with sided inventories.

-Inserters and Block Breakers no longer crash when asked to compare NBT of items that don't have NBT.

-Inserters now send much lower amount of sync packets, will significantly reduce bandwidth usage.

-Ingot blocks now have proper pickaxe level requirements (same level as their ore counterparts).

-Diodes no longer allow reverse current flow.

-All multiblocks now have proper render boxes, no longer rendered when out of view.

-Pumpjack no longer drains one block of oil without power.

-Oil Distillery and Refinery no longer allow piping fluids in their output tanks.


REMOVED:

-WIP items and blocks that shouldn't have been there in the first place.
